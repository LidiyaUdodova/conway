TODO: 

1) Include the delta value to the SVM classification.
   - Delta is how many "steps" cells are simulated (usually 4~5)
   - Delta can have a profound effect on the result.

2) Add socring function.
   - Just (1-error).
   - Need to be ~0.1.

3) Very slow SVM classification step.
   - Dimensionality reduction step? PCA?
   - Dimensionality reduction is a good candidate because the cells that
     are far away to each other probably never interact.

dump_400-dim-results predicted 400 cells with 1/5 datasets, error = 0.143404, took ~6 hours.
